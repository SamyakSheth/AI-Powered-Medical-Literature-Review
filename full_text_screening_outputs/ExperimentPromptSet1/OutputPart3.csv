Tribukait et al.\n\nIntratympanic instillations of gentamicin are a well-established treatment in patients with disabling peripheral vestibular disorders (13–15). In the present investigation the SVH for different body positions was measured before and repeatedly during a follow-up period of 1 year after gentamicin treatment. The major aim was to establish whether changes in SVH after gentamicin treatment are comparable to those seen after unilateral vestibular nerve section (10, 11) and in the acute stage of vestibular neuritis (6). In particular, we wanted to index the otolithic components of vestibular compensation by means of repetitive measurements of SVH.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatients'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 15.172455787658691}, page_content='# DISCUSSION\n\nSubjective visual horizontal in the upright body position, B0\n\nThe present study has shown that chemical labyrinthectomy causes changes in B0 that are comparable to changes reported in the acute stage after unilateral vestibular neurectomy and vestibular neuritis.

Introduction\n\nA unique feature of the central nervous system is the capacity for compensation of asymmetries in bilateral peripheral vestibular afferent activity. However, some patients display incomplete compensation. Patients who have previously suffered from an acute peripheral insult such as vestibular neuritis often complain of feeling dizzy or being unable to walk immediately due to ‘‘whirling’’ sensations [1].\n\nFor patients with chronic vestibular insufficiency, vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) was developed and introduced in the 1990s based on an original principle [2,3]. VRT is indicated for almost all cases in which compensation is insufficient, even for patients with multifactorial balance disorders such as those seen in the elderly [3].

In 1941, Dandy described two specific secondary symptoms following bilateral vestibular neurectomies performed on patients with bilateral Meniere\'s disease (1). The first symptom was oscillopsia, a visual distortion like a jumbling image, occurring either during motion or with head movements. A severe imbalance was observed during darkness as the second symptom. Bilateral loss of vestibular function is for this reason also called ""Dandy Syndrome"". Few studies in the literature have been reported regarding this particular otoneurologic condition (2-6).\n\nAmong all the electronystagmograms (ENG) performed between 1982 and 1993 in the neuro-otology laboratories of Berne and Geneva, 52 (0.6%) revealed an absence of bilateral nystagmic reaction with both caloric (44-30 and 10°C water irrigation) and rotatory pendular testing (0.05 Hz/peak velocity 60°/s).')], 'answer': '{\n""answer"": ""No"",\n""reason"": ""The abstract states that the study is about bilateral idiopathic loss of peripheral vestibular function, which is a rare condition.

Hearing loss as the presenting symptom of MC is very uncommon. A patient with an esophageal signet ring cell carcinoma 3 years previously presented with sudden onset of profound hearing loss affecting both ears. He had no evidence of local tumor recurrence. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed swelling and increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images of both acoustic nerves and the right trigeminal nerve. After gadolinium administration, enhancement of both acoustic and trigeminal nerves was seen. He later developed unsteadiness and head-movement-dependent oscillopsia due to vestibular areflexia and diplopia. At that time MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement. MC was diagnosed, although cerebrospinal fluid cytology could not confirm that diagnosis. The patient died 16 weeks after the onset of deafness.

In the Western hemisphere, most ectopic ureters are one moiety of a duplex system, but in South East Asia, single ectopic ureters are more common. The pathology and clinical features of single ectopic ureter have been well described but this condition continues to cause diagnostic confusion and sometimes therapeutic delay. In a retrospective study, we determined the association of renal function with the site of the ectopic ureteric orifice, evaluated the efficacy of the investigations used for diagnosis and assessed the role of ureteric reimplantation in the preservation of renal function.\n\n# Accepted for publication 21 April 1998\n\nThe review comprised 44 patients (41 female and three male, age 1.5 months to 20 years); 28 patients presented within the first 3 years of life and the rest afterwards.

The actual location of origin along the 2-cm course from the brainstem to the vestibular end is important clinically, within the bony confines of the internal auditory canal.The lobular pattern most likely does not reflect a multiclonal source of these schwannomas, since NF2 schwannomas have been found to be monoclonal.

Tumor response to repeat GKS was classified into 4 categories according to tumor volume as follows: regression (more than 10% volume reduction as compared with the volume at the second GKS), stabilization (volume alteration within 10% of the volume), enlargement more than 10% volume increase not requiring subsequent intervention, failure (uncontrollable tumor growth requiring further intervention and/or appearance of disabling radiation side effect).\n\n# RESULTS'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.43979263305664}, page_content='Neurosurgery 64:48–55, 2009 DOI: 10.1227/01.NEU.0000327692.74477.D5 www.neurosurgery-online.com\n\nOver the past decade, the quality of gamma knife surgery (GKS) has increased for patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS).

Many investigators have reported long-term efficacy and low procedural complication rates. In modern series, treatment failures are rare, occurring in less than 5% of cases. However, the management of failure and/or tumor regrowth is an important issue. Microsurgical resection is an established treatment option for a growing VS after GKS, although rates of preservation of cranial nerve function with this procedure vary widely.

The median time interval between the 2 interventions in the present study was 46 months. The combination of low-dose treatment and the fact that the median interval between treatments was almost 4 years could theoretically have worked in favor of protection of facial nerve function.

Following UVD, the static symptoms, including spontaneous ocular nystagmus and head tilt, undergo recovery through a process of ‘‘vestibular compensation’’ and this is partially due to the recovery of resting activity in neurons in the vestibular nucleus complex (see Smith and Curthoys, 1989; Curthoys and Halmagyi, 1995 for reviews).

Mumps, a disease that usually affects the salivary glands, is the most common cause of unilateral acquired sensorineural hearing loss, especially in children. Deafness caused by mumps is usually profound and permanent. Atrophy of hair cells have been observed [22], indicating severe damage to the cochlea as a result of virus infection. The effect of mumps infection on the function of otolith organs in the vestibular system has rarely been studied. Our findings indicate that otolith organ dysfunction should also be considered as one of the major concerns after mumps infection, especially in patients exhibiting profound hearing loss.

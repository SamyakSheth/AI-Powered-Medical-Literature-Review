Determining differences in vestibulo-spinal reflex (VSR) influences on balance control and vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) responses with peripheral recovery and central compensation would provide insights into CNS plasticity mechanisms. Also, clinically, knowing when balance control is approximately normal again should contribute to decisions about working ability after aUPVD.

Animal studies have demonstrated the importance of cervical sensory information for postural control. Receptors in the cervical spine make important connections to the vestibular and visual apparatus as well as to several areas of the central nervous system. The importance of neck input is clear from the fact that dizziness and subjective balance disturbances are common complaints in cervical pain syndromes. When one of these sources of input is impaired, a process known as vestibular compensation acts to stabilize postural adjustments.

However, none of our patients had a previous history of a brainstem lesion and all of them were able to hear their eyeball movements when moved in any direction.

It seems that there is a clear dissociation between the subjective visual vertical and the subjective visual postural. Actually, despite their loss in sensitivity for perception of body verticality, bilateral-defective patients are as accurate as healthy subjects in determining their body position in space (subjective postural vertical) during roll [14] and pitch [27] body tilts.

In general, the caloric test was more sensitive in detection of vestibular hypofunction than the vHIT. These findings are similar to other studies reporting vestibular function testing in patients with chronic vestibular symptoms with very similar sensitivity for vHIT compared with caloric testing. Mahringer and colleagues reported that 33% of patients with symptom onset greater than five days with a unilateral weakness on caloric testing also had a pathological vHIT test. In our study 17/51 (33%) with a UVH had an abnormal vHIT. Three of our abnormal vHIT cases had a normal caloric test.

Abnormal vHIT was defined as angular velocity gain (peak eye velocity/peak head velocity) less than 0.79 at 80 ms and 0.75 at 60 ms, which was two standard deviations below our institutions’ lower limit of normal; together with refixation saccades. Abnormal bi-thermal caloric testing defined unilateral hypofunction as a 25% difference using Jongkee’s formula and bilateral hypofunction was defined by the sum of the peak slow phase velocities over the four irrigations being <20°/s. Sixty patients had abnormal results on one or both tests, of whom 51 had unilateral and nine bilateral hypofunction.

Whereas caloric testing was more sensitive than vHIT in detecting UVH, the opposite was true in the nine patients with BVH. The literature is unclear on the level at which bilateral vestibular failure is diagnosed from caloric results. We modified the criteria used in past studies which determined caloric responses <5°/sec for each of the four separate irrigations (hot and cold irrigations in both ears) indicated BVH. We used the PPSPV of the four irrigations being ≤20° resulting in 4/9 (44%) cases meeting this criteria on caloric testing. However, this is probably an indication of near total BVH. Whereas UVH with partial loss of function is reasonably defined there may be patients with a partial BVH on caloric testing whose results are still within the normal range.

However in this study, we found evidence that supports the continued use of both vHIT and caloric tests in patients with sub-acute and chronic symptoms, particularly if the vHIT is normal.

Under normal condition, there is a balance of pressure between the CSF and perilymph via the cochlear aqueduct (if permeable) [19]. An experimental study proved that intracranial pressure changes are transmitted to the inner ear by passive liquid transfer; rapid if the cochlear canal is permeable, and slow when it is non-functional [7]. Therefore, the reduction of the perilymph due to CSF hypovolemia would result in compensatory endolymphatic hydrops that will in turn generate vertigo and auditory dysfunction mimicking MD.

The most common etiology is vestibular neuritis, which accounts for 7% of visits to vertigo clinics.

Vestibular suppressants, such as meclizine, are commonly used but are no better than a placebo and do not improve balance. Steroids may accelerate recovery but offer no long-term benefit. The mainstay of treatment for UVH is vestibular rehabilitation (VR).\n\nDespite the benefits, there are significant limitations to the current VR techniques.

Radiosurgery is typically performed as gamma knife surgery (GKS), although other modalities are being applied with increasing frequency. A differentiating feature in responsiveness to microsurgery or GKS is whether the VS is cystic or solid. A cystic VS is less responsive to GKS than a solid VS, representing a challenging clinical problem.

A differentiating feature in responsiveness to microsurgery or GKS is whether the VS is cystic or solid. A cystic VS is less responsive to GKS than a solid VS, representing a challenging clinical problem.

In line with this, the three MD patients with an increased cVEMP amplitude on the affected side in our study had experienced audio-vestibular symptoms for less than 2 years, whereas those with a reduced amplitude had a mean disease duration of 8.6 years. Histopathological analyses in MD have shown that the saccule is affected more often by ELH than the utricle [35].

Vestibular compensation occurs in patients with vestibular neuritis, vestibular schwannoma or surgery in Menière’s disease [5,7,17,22]. For example, in patients with vestibular schwannoma, vestibular compensation accompanies the gradual vestibular dysfunction caused by the tumor growth [7]. The surgical removal of the tumor, which corresponds to an acute unilateral vestibular deafferentation, leads to a decompensation of this previously compensated situation, and mainly explains the severe vertigo and balance impairments reported by patients after surgery. Therefore, balance is impaired after surgical removal and recovers progressively after surgery [19,22,29]. Thus, compensation plays a major role in reorganizing and normalizing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) in patients with unilateral vestibular lesion (UVL) [20].'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 14.672260284423828}, page_content='put seems therefore to dominate over the vestibular one [18]. However the situation can be assumed to be different in patients with vestibular asymmetries. First, skull vibration will cause an asymmetric vestibular input in the case of a unilateral vestibular loss as there is an asymmetric disposition of the otolithic organs. Vibration to posterior cervical muscles might thus to some extent propagate to the healthy vestibular organ and induce tonic ocular torsion limiting therefore the efficient use of visual input [15]. Secondly, a vestibular asymmetry may cause an asymmetric vestibulo-spinal activation as seen in the Fukuda/Unterberger test, thus causing a cervical stimulation to return an asymmetric response in its own right. Indeed, the changes in visual perception induced by neck muscle vibration might represent an increased central weighting of somatosensory neck information from the side with the lesion, which substitutes for a missing vestibular input [27].

Shupert et al proposed that vestibulopathic patients use greater hip movements because they lack trunk stability, causing greater CG excursions.

In the acute state, the head movements on the healthy side are better controlled, although a mild head tilt towards the lesion side can still be revealed.

Asymmetry in utricular function has been quantified with subjective visual horizontal (SVH) or subjective visual vertical (SVV) testing [2, 3]. In these tests, a healthy subject can typically align illuminated bar within two degrees of true earth horizontal or vertical in total darkness. Instead, acute unilateral peripheral vestibular loss causes a moderate tilt of visual surroundings towards the affected side. This tilt of visual surroundings in SVH and SVV has been shown to concur closely with eye torsion, which is initiated by asymmetry of utricular input in the level of vestibular nuclei [4].'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 14.85917854309082}, page_content='Subjective head horizontal tilting seems to be well comparable to the subjective visual horizontal/vertical values presented after acute unilateral vestibular loss.

The discrepancies in these results are similar to those found throughout the literature indicating inconsistencies in direction of rotation either toward or away from the side of lesion (Peitersen, 1964, 1967).

However, in the presence of increased sensitivity for the severe UW group, it is uncertain what information this would provide to a clinician. A turn greater than 30° may imply a unilateral vestibular hypofunction toward or away from the turn, or a false positive result. Even for those individuals who obtained 100% caloric unilateral weakness, the FST results did not correlate with a turn toward the weakness. It should be noted that six individuals had a caloric UW of 100%, and of these six individuals, all deviated (rotated) from starting position during the standard FST and FST following head shake; however, only three had FST turns in the direction of the caloric UW.

Although a previous study showed activation in the hippocampus by vestibular stimulation (Stephan et al., 2005), that area is not classically considered part of the cortical vestibular network. Thus, our hypothesis is as following: vestibular rehabilitation exercise during follow-up increased the GMV in areas associated with spatial memory, which was then facilitated by recovery of peripheral vestibular input. GMV increases associated with learning have been replicated in the hippocampus, where neurogenesis occurs during adulthood (Zatorre et al., 2012). The discrepancy between this study and previous reports can be explained in two ways. First, previous region of interest-based studies did not include the hippocampus (Helmchen et al., 2009, 2011).

Previous studies have shown the transient influence of sensory stimulation on tactile extinction. In the present two case studies we investigated whether subliminal galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) modulates tactile extinction. GVS induces polarity-specific changes in cerebral excitability in the vestibular cortices and adjacent cortical areas in the temporo-parietal cortex via polarization of the vestibular nerves. Two patients (DL, CJ) with left-sided tactile extinction due to chronic (5 vs. 6 (1/2) years lesion age) right-hemisphere lesions (right fronto-parietal in DL, right frontal and discrete parietal in CJ) were examined. Both showed normal tactile sensitivity to light touch and yielded 90–100% correct identifications in unilateral tactile stimulations for both hands. In Baseline investigations without GVS and Sham-GVS both showed stable left-sided tactile extinction rates of 40–55% (DL) and 49–72% (CJ). In contrast, one'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.815003395080566}, page_content='induced by GVS are similar to those induced by caloric vestibular stimulation (see Section 4.2, below). Only a few studies have so far evaluated the potency of GVS in patients with neglect, extinction and related spatial disorders. In a first, pioneering study Rorsman, Magnusson, and Johansson (1999) have shown a transient reduction of visual neglect symptoms in patients with neglect (i.e. line cancellation) during right-cathodal GVS. A recent case study found a significant improvement in visuoconstructive deficits (copy of Rey-figure) during GVS (Wilkinson, Zubko, Degutis, Milberg, & Potter, 2010). Another study (Saj, Honore, & Rousseaux, 2006) reported online-effects of left-cathodal GVS on the counterclockwise tilt of the subjective visual vertical in patients with visual neglect. As outlined above, GVS induces polarity-specific activation of the brain. As tactile extinction is viewed by some theories (Schwartz et al., 1979) as a result of an imbalance of sensory inputs received simultaneously from both'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.478314399719238}, page_content='et al., 1979) as a result of an imbalance of sensory inputs received simultaneously from both hands we hypothesized that GVS may influence tactile extinction via activations of the vestibular cortices and adjacent temporoparietal cortices in the brain. From the available literature on GVS we expected a transient reduction of left-sided extinction errors under GVS, but no specific effect on right-sided errors induced by GVS. Regarding polarity we had no directional hypothesis as some of the few available GVS studies showed improvements during left-cathodal GVS, others during right-cathodal GVS (as mentioned above). In the present case studies we therefore explored the effects of GVS on tactile extinction in two patients with a chronic (5 vs. 6 (1/2) years post lesion), right hemispheric lesion. Apart from online-stimulation effects we were interested in the after-effects of GVS and potential enduring effects on tactile extinction.'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.35571575164795}, page_content='Neurophysiological studies in primates all have indicated the parietal lobe as the main projection area of vestibular input. Electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve showed a cortical projection to Brodman area 2 (Schwarz & Fredrickson, 1971) and evoked potentials showed cortical activations in Brodman area 3 (Ödkvist, Schwarz, Fredrickson, & Hassler, 1974). Functional imaging studies using caloric vestibular stimulation show activations in areas of the perisylvian cortex including the insula and retroinsular cortex, the temporoparietal cortex, the putamen, somatosensory area II (Bottini et al., 2001), as well as in the intraparietal cortex (Chokron, Dupierrix, Tabert, & Bartolomeo, 2007; Suzuki et al., 2001). In accordance with these activations, numerous studies using caloric vestibular stimulation have shown a beneficial influence on neglect and neglect-related disorders such as extinction (Vallar et al., 1993), somatoparaphrenia (Rode et al., 1992) or unawareness of hemiplegia (for review see'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.18184757232666}, page_content='Dieterich, & Danek, 1994). Further activation was found in the middle and superior temporal gyrus, the putamen, the anterior cingulate gyrus and thalamus (Bense, Stephan, Yousry, Brandt, & Dieterich, 2001; Lobel, Kleine, Bihan, Leroy-Willig, & Berthoz, 1998). Interestingly, the cerebral activation pattern after left-cathodal and right-cathodal GVS is asymmetric in the human vestibular cortices. Placing the cathode behind the right ear (right-cathodal GVS) induces inhibition of the left and excitation of the right vestibular nerve, followed by unilateral activation of the right vestibular and parietal cortex as well as in adjacent areas. In contrast, placing the cathode behind the left ear (left-cathodal GVS) inhibits the right and excites the left vestibular nerve which in turn induces bilateral activations of the vestibular and parietal cortex, as well as in adjacent areas (Fink et al., 2003).

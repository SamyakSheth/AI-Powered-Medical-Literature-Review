Direction-changing positional nystagmus on the supine roll test is a characteristic clinical feature in horizontal semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. One of several mechanisms of spontaneous nystagmus is plugging of the otoconia, which has been described as a canalith jam.'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 10.184846878051758}, page_content='# Discussion\n\nSpontaneous nystagmus can sometimes occur in HSC-BPPV, although direction-changing positional nystagmus on the supine roll test is a pathognomic clinical feature. Generally, 2 mechanisms explain spontaneous nystagmus in HSC-BPPV. First, the HSC is anatomically tilted 30° upward relative to the horizontal plane in the neutral position. This natural inclination of the HSC can produce a slow falling of the otoconia in the utriculofugal direction caused by gravity. In this case, spontaneous nystagmus should easily be changed by forward or backward movement of the head. Second, plugging of the endolymph with the otoconia may evoke permanent utriculofugal deflection of the cupula in the HSC, resulting in nonfatiguing spontaneous horizontal nystagmus.

The risk percentage was derived from our institution’s 20-years follow-up results for stapes surgery [3]. This would mean at minimum a bilateral risk percentage of 0.01% if the ears were considered independent from each other.

A sudden unilateral loss or impairment of vestibular function causes vertigo, dizziness and impaired postural function. In most occasions, everyday activities supported or not by vestibular rehabilitation programs will promote compensation and the symptoms subside. As the compensatory process requires sensory input, matching performed motor activity, both motor learning of exercises and matching to sensory input are required. If there is a simultaneous cerebellar lesion found during surgery of the posterior cranial fossa, there may be a risk of a combined vestibulo-cerebellar lesion, with reduced compensatory abilities and with prolonged or sometimes permanent disability.

RVM sites are not usually considered as primary sites for initiating and terminating different states. However, Darnall et al. (2001) pointed out that these medullary sites are part of a neural circuit that includes the locus coeruleus, which is involved in vigilance and arousal. It is thus possible that neurotoxic lesions and muscimol dialysis affected ‘groups of neurons involved in modulation of arousal, increasing the probability of EEG desynchronization and WK’ (Darnall et al., 2001).

The study of an American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2001-2004) showed that the vestibular dysfunction escalated over time, so almost 85% of people aged 80 or more have vestibular dysfunction. Besides, the people with vestibular impairments have eight times higher a risk of falling, which is worrying due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with falls (Agrawal, Carey, Della Santina, Schubert, & Minor, 2009; Quitschal, Fukunaga, Ganança, & Caovilla, 2014), as well as the enormous expenses of the related healthcare (Stevens, Corso, Finkelstein, & Miller, 2006; Dellinger, & Stevens 2006). The division of patients according to gender (Table 1) shows that there was a greater ratio of women in both groups, in the ratio of even above 2:1.

Our central hypothesis is that a hemispheric lesion resulting in limb muscle spasticity leads to an imbalance in the activity of ascending vestibuloocular pathways (due to shared anatomy). In this scenario, a lateralized disruption in corticobulbar projections releases the spastic–paretic (clinically affected) vestibular nuclei and their associated ascending and descending pathways from inhibitory cortical control. We postulate that within an individual subject, the degree of asymmetry in OVEMP amplitude between the spastic–paretic and contralateral sides reflects an imbalance in ascending vestibuloocular drive.

First, given the inherent variability in both lesion size and site, it is not surprising that a small subset of subjects had negative asymmetry ratios. Compared to subjects with more focal lesions, these subjects tended to have diffuse lesions (subject 17) involving multiple areas and likely impacted various ascending and descending pathways. Second, the course of recovery and reorganization of cortical areas following stroke is dependent on intrinsic mechanisms that vary as a function of the time post-stroke as well as the site and extent of the lesion (Teasell et al., 2005).

In the majority of subjects, the spastic-paretic corrected interpeak amplitude was larger than the contralateral corrected interpeak amplitude, a difference reflected in the finding of a positive asymmetry ratio.

This finding underlines the importance of a stable horizontal gaze fixation for suppression of imbalance-related discomfort and anxiety, as well as for postural stability. In EV, perceived symptom intensity and HRQoL likely depend less on the impairment of vestibular signal input, but rather on behavioural cofactors (like coping, resilience or comorbid anxiety).

Introduction\n\nInnervation of the vestibular organs is provided by two branches of the vestibular nerve: the superior branch receives input from the horizontal and anterior semicircular canal (SCC) and the utriculus, the inferior branch contains axons from the posterior SCC and the sacculus. Sudden unilateral peripheral–vestibular hypofunction (UVH) typically presents as acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). The most frequent cause of UVH is inflammation of the vestibular nerve. After acute UVH, symptoms such as vertigo/dizziness, imbalance of stance and spontaneous nystagmus resolve within days to weeks. This is usually achieved by central compensatory mechanisms including re-weighting of multisensory (vestibular, somatosensory, visual) input and by minimizing the vestibular tone.'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 15.16446590423584}, page_content='All potential study participants received vestibular testing before inclusion and the pattern of the peripheral–vestibular deficit was determined.

For gains, cut-off values of 0.8 (horizontal canals) and 0.7 (vertical canals) were proposed by the manufacturer, which have recently been confirmed over a broad range of ages (McGarvie et al., 2015). Sacculus function was assessed by cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) and utriculus function by ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs).

The low VOR gain present on turning the head towards the side of the lesion generates considerable retinal slip in VN patients and, reciprocally, retinal slip during head motion is undoubtedly the mechanism underlying locomotion oscillopsia in bilateral vestibular patients.

Conclusions\n\nWe established that mental disorder rates in patients with audiovestibular diseases increase in accordance with the presence of solo vertigo, vertigo accompanied by hearing loss, repeated symptoms, and bilateral hearing loss. Physicians should therefore consider various treatment strategies for patients who have persistent nystagmus, a history of prolonged disease duration, and/or hearing loss in the secondary affected ear to avoid development of a psychological disorder.\n\n# Conflicts of interest\n\nNone.\n\n# Financial disclosures\n\nNone.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr. Michiko Shuto, a registered statistician (certificate number: 62720218), for helpful advice on statistical analysis.

In the present study, persistent nystagmus in patients with Menie`re’s disease was not a significant negative prognostic factor in regard to the mental state. Because symptoms in BPPV disappear immediately after free-moving otoliths disappear from the canal endolymph, the persistent nystagmus in patients with Menie`re’s disease may be mainly caused by secondary BPPV. If dynamic vestibular compensation is not perfectly accomplished after static vestibular compensation, motion-induced dizziness plagues the patient’s daily life for a long time. Similarly, as longer disease duration in patients with vestibular neuritis was also a negative prognostic factor for the mental state in our study, persistent nystagmus in these patients may be mainly caused by delayed dynamic vestibular compensation. The differences between patients who have sudden deafness with vertigo and those with vestibular neuritis may result from the different otopathology (i.e., different sites of peripheral vestibular lesions) [9,16].'), Document(metadata={'relevance_score': 12.103785514831543}, page_content='We attempted here to identify prognostic factors that could negatively affect mental conditions in patients with each audiovestibular disease.

Persistent nystagmus portended a negative prognosis regarding the mentality of patients who had sudden deafness with vertigo. In patients with vestibular neuritis, a longer duration of disease and persistent nystagmus had a negative effect.

GVS is a non-invasive vestibular stimulation that is, unlike caloric vestibular stimulation, easier to use, lacking adverse side effects (with currents <1.5 mA) and therefore appears more appropriate for repetitive treatment without habituation effects (Utz et al., 2010, 2011b). Practically, weak direct currents (DCs) are delivered via two electrodes of different polarity (anode and cathode) attached to the two mastoids behind the ears. On the neural level, GVS induces polarization effects in the vestibular nerves, leading to an activation of the semicircular canals, otolith organs, and the adjacent vestibular nerves (Fitzpatrick and Day, 2004). Cortical activation is seen in the posterior insula and the temporo-parietal region in healthy subjects during GVS.
